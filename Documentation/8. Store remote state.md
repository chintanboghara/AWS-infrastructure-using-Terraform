# Store Remote State with HCP Terraform

Remote state storage is a critical feature for secure, collaborative, and scalable infrastructure management. This guide details how to use HCP (HashiCorp Cloud Platform) Terraform to securely store state remotely and run Terraform processes in a shared environment.

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following:
1. Completed prior tutorials with a directory named `terraform-aws-instance`.
2. The `main.tf` configuration file in the directory.

#### `main.tf` Example
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.16"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 1.2.0"
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami           = "ami-08d70e59c07c61a3a"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

Initialize and apply the configuration locally to ensure your infrastructure is properly set up:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### **Set Up HCP Terraform Integration**

#### **1. Add the Cloud Block to `main.tf`**
Update `main.tf` to include the HCP Terraform cloud block. Replace `"organization-name"` with your HCP organization name.

```hcl
terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "organization-name"
    workspaces {
      name = "terraform-aws"
    }
  }

  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.16"
    }
  }
}
```

#### **2. Log In to HCP Terraform**
Log in to your HCP Terraform account using the CLI:

```bash
terraform login
```

Follow the instructions in the terminal and browser to authenticate. Terraform will generate and save an API token locally in `~/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json`.

### **Migrate Your State to HCP Terraform**

Reinitialize your Terraform configuration to migrate your local state file to HCP Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

You will be prompted to confirm the migration of your existing state to the HCP Terraform workspace:

```plaintext
Do you wish to proceed?
...
Should Terraform migrate your existing state?
Enter a value: yes
```

After migration, delete the local state file for security:

```bash
rm terraform.tfstate
```

### **Set Workspace Variables in HCP**

Navigate to your workspace (`terraform-aws`) in the HCP Terraform web UI. Under the **Variables** section:
1. Add **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** and **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY** as **Environment Variables**.
2. Mark these variables as **Sensitive** for secure storage.

### **Run Terraform Remotely**

Trigger a Terraform run in HCP to confirm that the setup works:

```bash
terraform apply
```

If there are no changes to your configuration, you will see output similar to the following:

```plaintext
No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.
```

### **Destroy Infrastructure via HCP**

When cleaning up, you can destroy your infrastructure using the remote state:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Terraform will execute the destroy process in HCP Terraform and stream the output to your terminal. Confirm the operation when prompted:

```plaintext
Do you want to perform these actions?
Enter a value: yes
```

Alternatively, you can confirm the operation directly in the HCP Terraform web UI.

### **Benefits of HCP Terraform**
- **Centralized State:** Securely stores your state remotely, preventing local corruption or loss.
- **Collaboration:** Enables multiple team members to work on infrastructure with shared state.
- **Secure Secrets:** Stores sensitive values (e.g., API tokens) securely in HCP.
- **Remote Execution:** Allows Terraform to run remotely, ensuring a stable environment for long-running processes.

With your Terraform state now securely stored in HCP, your infrastructure management becomes more collaborative and resilient.
