# Change Infrastructure
### Modify Configuration
In this file, you will modify the existing EC2 instance to use a different AMI.

1. Update the `ami` in the `aws_instance.app_server` resource:
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami           = "ami-08d70e59c07c61a3a"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

### Apply Changes
2. Run the following command to apply the updated configuration:
```bash
terraform apply
```
The execution plan will display changes with `-/+`, indicating the resource will be destroyed and recreated.

Respond to the confirmation prompt with `yes`.

3. Terraform will first destroy the existing instance and then create a new one:
```bash
aws_instance.app_server: Destroying... [id=i-01e03375ba238b384]
aws_instance.app_server: Destruction complete after 42s
aws_instance.app_server: Creating...
aws_instance.app_server: Creation complete after 50s [id=i-0fd4a35969bd21710]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 1 destroyed.
```

### Inspect New State
4. To inspect the updated state, run:
```bash
terraform show
```
This will display the metadata of the newly created instance.

## Troubleshooting
1. Ensure the `ami` is valid for your selected AWS region. Replace `ami-08d70e59c07c61a3a` with a region-specific AMI if needed.
2. If no default VPC exists, create one using the AWS VPC Dashboard. Update the configuration with the appropriate `vpc_security_group_ids` and `subnet_id` arguments.

Example:
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami                    = "ami-08d70e59c07c61a3a"
  instance_type          = "t2.micro"
  vpc_security_group_ids = ["sg-0077..."]
  subnet_id              = "subnet-923a..."
}
```

With these steps, you can efficiently modify and manage your infrastructure using Terraform.
