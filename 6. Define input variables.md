# Defining Input Variables

Terraform configurations can include variables to make your configuration more dynamic and flexible. This tutorial walks you through defining and using input variables in Terraform.

## Prerequisites

After following earlier tutorials, you should have a directory named `learn-terraform-aws-instance` with the following configuration in a file called `main.tf`:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.16"
    }
  }

  required_version = ">= 1.2.0"
}

provider "aws" {
  region  = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami           = "ami-08d70e59c07c61a3a"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleAppServerInstance"
  }
}
```

Ensure that your configuration matches this, and that you have run `terraform init` in the `learn-terraform-aws-instance` directory.

## Step 1: Set the Instance Name with a Variable

The current configuration includes several hard-coded values. Terraform variables allow you to write flexible and reusable configurations.

### Create a Variable for the Instance Name

1. Create a new file called `variables.tf` with the following content:

   ```hcl
   variable "instance_name" {
     description = "Value of the Name tag for the EC2 instance"
     type        = string
     default     = "ExampleAppServerInstance"
   }
   ```

2. Update the `aws_instance` resource block in `main.tf` to use the new variable:

   ```hcl
   resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
     ami           = "ami-08d70e59c07c61a3a"
     instance_type = "t2.micro"

     tags = {
       Name = var.instance_name
     }
   }
   ```

   The `instance_name` variable will default to the value `"ExampleAppServerInstance"` unless you declare a different value.

## Step 2: Apply the Configuration

1. Apply the configuration with the default value for `instance_name`. Respond to the confirmation prompt with `yes`.

   ```bash
   $ terraform apply
   ```

   Terraform will generate the following execution plan:

   ```
   Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
   Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
     + create

   Terraform will perform the following actions:

     # aws_instance.app_server will be created
     + resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
         + ami                          = "ami-08d70e59c07c61a3a"
         + arn                          = (known after apply)
         ##...
   Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
   ```

   Once confirmed, Terraform will create the instance.

2. Override the default `instance_name` by passing a variable value with the `-var` flag:

   ```bash
   $ terraform apply -var "instance_name=YetAnotherName"
   ```

   Terraform will detect the change and update the `Name` tag in-place:

   ```
   Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
   Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
     ~ update in-place

   Terraform will perform the following actions:

     # aws_instance.app_server will be updated in-place
     ~ resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
           id                           = "i-0bf954919ed765de1"
         ~ tags                         = {
             ~ "Name" = "ExampleAppServerInstance" -> "YetAnotherName"
           }
         # (26 unchanged attributes hidden)

         # (4 unchanged blocks hidden)
       }

   Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.
   ```

   Confirm with `yes` to apply the update.

## Notes on Setting Variables

Setting variables via the command-line does not save their values. Terraform supports several methods to use and set variables to avoid having to enter them repeatedly:

- **Variable Definitions Files**: Store variables in `.tfvars` files.
- **Environment Variables**: Set variables as `TF_VAR_<variable_name>`.
- **CLI Input Flags**: Use the `-var` flag for ad-hoc overrides.

Using these methods ensures a smoother workflow and allows you to manage variables effectively in different environments.

This completes the process of defining and using input variables in Terraform.
